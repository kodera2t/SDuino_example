# SDuino_example
Once I was excited to see Intel's announce that they will release "SD card sized (SD card shaped) computer", 
but it was not true. This time I made a real SD card sized full programmable (indeed, Arduino pro compatible) 
small computer board, which is released at
https://hackaday.io/project/6435-sd-card-sized-board-lets-say-sduino
On this repository, I would upload practical application of SDuino. First one is "weather forecast SDuino" wich I2C pressure sensor
Have fun!
